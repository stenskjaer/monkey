# My Monkey implementation

This repository contains my version of Thorsten Ball's *Writing an Interpreter in Go*. 

For more information about the book, see [https://interpreterbook.com/](https://interpreterbook.com/).

My personal aim with this, aside from improving my Go skills and writing my first full programming language, is to eventually revise the TeX parser that is implemented (more or less by accident) in [*Samewords*](https://github.com/stenskjaer/samewords), a small utility that I have written for modifying TeX source files for critical text editing in academia.
